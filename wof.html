<p> Once upon a time in the distant past of 2008, two metalheads joined together to form the extreme avant-garde super group,
	'Wizaard of Faeces', a formation so iconoclastic and monumental that it rocked the music world forever. A sound so ahead of its time
	that it is still yet to be matched and rivalled over a dozen years later. After the release of their EP, 'Gut The Virgin Mary', which recieved
	at least one accolade from NME (New Musical Express, British music journalism website), the band garnered a small following in Ethiopa and rural
	 South-West England. <br><br>Scheduling, and line-up change has rocked 'WOF' with increasingly long delays, and has put future releases on hold.
	 Whilst they have yet to release a true 'follow up' or even a full album, many have eagerly awaited a 'Return to Faeces'.

<p id="GTVMEP"> Gut The Virgin Mary EP 2008 - Whilst only six tracks have survived out of the original thirty one, Gut The Virgin Mary EP was nothing short of 
	iconic. Featuring some of the bands best known work such as, Crucifiction Masturbation and Maggot Gut Fucking, this EP paved the way for 
	the extreme genre of Technical Melodic Grind-Code. With Alistair Costley-White as Lead Vocals, his 'soaring eagle shriek', 
	'belly of the beast' growls, and unmatched 'rap-god' rapping style, and Matthew Pitcairn on Visual Basic Express, a drum machine and synth, they 
	formed a powerful alliance that was only ended by the impending destruction of Alistairs throat and love for true artistry.

<h3>Return to Faeces (20XX)</h3>
<p>	Following the stifled and broken release of their internationally adored, award winning demo release 'Gut The Virgin Mary', the band took
	a long needed rest. With the degradation of Alistairs throat, Matthew needed a new vocalist for the nightmarish follow up. After scouring the lands
	for almost a decade he came upon the actor William Bazire, and after seeing the influence that William had on George Miller, took him in to
	have as new Lead Vocalist, an imposing figure who could match Alistairs infamous screams in his own unique way. Soon after, Duncan Bazire,
	legendary cyclist and lead actor in pre-production 'Gears of Gore' joined the project, bringing in the unique sound of a Bass Guitar 
	<strong><i>not</i></strong> being played.
	<br>
	<br>
	With a new alliance formed, the band has spent years delving into the minds of the mad and exploring their artistic avenues, forging and creative
	new ways for instruments to be played and sounds to be made. William Bazire recently took over as 'Resident Synth' and Matthew remains the glue
	that holds this almost non-existent dead band together.
	Whilst they have yet to release anything new, a teaser announcing their 'Return' was posted online around four years ago, the song title 
	"Excavating the Unborn Bastard" was confirmed to be one of the eight tracks in production. When will the Wizaard return?
